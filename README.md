This project is from Codecademy's Business Intelligence Analyst Career Path.

**Project Scope**

This project scope is to examine the biodiversity data from the National Parks Service about endangered species.

I performed analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and investigated if there were any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. During this project, I cleaned, analyzed, and created meaningful visualisations of the data.
